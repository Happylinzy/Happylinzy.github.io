### Education
**SJTU**: UM-JI ECE 23', CS 23', SJTU-Math 23', [IWINS-LAB](https://iwin-fins.com/)
**USC**: CE 24'

**Course TA**: Honor Calculus, Differential Equation

### Experience
[Naive Systems](https://naivesystems.com/) **Software Developer Intern** 2022/2 - 2022/5 

### Research Interest
> What I am curious about:
- Unified framework for gradient methods to explain BP network convergence.
- Accelration of executing on heterogenuous integration chips.

> What I am learning about:
- Dynamics of accelerated gradient methods unified as stationary solution of a particularly defined Lagrangian on tangent bundle of properly choosen Riemannian manifold.
- Numerical discretization of differential equations defined on connected graph for distributed consensus and optimization.
- Resilience of algorithms in distributed network under Byzantine or malicious attacks based on sensitivity analysis.

#### Application of Research:
Surface Smoothing, Image Processing, Optimization Solver, Statistical Analysis of Code.
